# django_url_shorterner

A simple url shorterner using google's url shortner API using the Django framework, my first django based project. The user is able to add, view and delete the analytics of the mini url created, however there is no sign up, login for the users.

Setup
Remarks: Assuming you have python installed and properly setup 
1. Clone the project, enter: git clone https://github.com/wackdot/django_url_shorterner
2. Open the project with a text editor / IDE
3. Install the required packages, enter: pip install requirements.txt
4. Run the project, enter: python manage.py runserver
5. In the browser, key in 127.0.0.1:8000/shorterner/request to load the main page (8000 is the default port number for Django, if you would like to use another port, key in the specific port number in the previous step after runserver (e.g. python manage.py runserver 4500 to user port 4500). Then remember to match it in the url replacing 8000 with 4500.

Note: You need to be on the same directory level as the txt / py file
